# Urban Data Science

This is a two course series on urban data science that I teach at the **University of Southern California**'s Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis.

The courses take a computational social science approach to working with urban data. We use Python and Jupyter notebooks to introduce coding and statistical methods that students can reproduce and experiment with in the cloud. We presume no prior knowledge as this course series introduces coding, stats, spatial analysis, and applied machine learning from the ground up.

## PPD534: Data, Evidence, and Communication for the Public Good

The first course, **PPD534**, starts with the basics of coding with Python, then on to data loading and analysis, then on to descriptive statistics, then inference and the scientific method, and finally a critical assessment of smart cities and urban informatics.

**PPD534** is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gboeing/ppd534) and interactively on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gboeing/ppd534/HEAD).

## PPD599: Advanced Urban Analytics

The second course, **PPD599**, assumes you have completed the first and builds on its topics. It introduces spatial analysis, network analysis, spatial models, and applied machine learning. It also digs deeper into the tools and workflows of urban data science in both research and practice.

**PPD599** is coming soon on GitHub and interactively on Binder.

## Next Steps

Are you interested in data science and spatial analysis to explore urban transportation patterns around the world, critically interrogate how big data reshapes housing affordability, or leverage technology platforms for more just, collaborative city planning? [Consider applying](https://geoffboeing.com/lab/) to the master's or PhD programs at USC!

We seek students from all backgrounds. If you're an activist or urbanist with no tech experience, we will teach you data/tech skills to effectively apply your knowledge to serve the community. If you're a coder or scientist interested in urbanism and planning, we will teach you how to unlock your skills for more equitable cities.
